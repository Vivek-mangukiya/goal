                                        ensuring that all MEP contractors quote the same amounts of work.
                                        This useful document helps you in selection of contractors and for
                                        tracking progress work against disbursed funds to contractors.
                                        Using a BOQ is a standard practice in construction projects, it brings many
                                        advantages during the tendering process:
